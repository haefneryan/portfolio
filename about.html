			<p class='description bioText'>Welcome to my Portfolio</p>
			<br>
			<p class='description bioText'>My name is Ryan Haefner, and I am a self-taught web developer.</p>
			<br>
			<p class='description bioText'>I've always enjoyed learning new things and trying to figure out how things work. That's what initally attracted me to engineering, the desire to understand how things work (and a slight nudge from mom).</p>
			<p class='description bioText'>In 2017, I graduated from college with a degree in engineering. I enjoyed the challenge of learning difficult subjects but also questioned how they were applicable to the real world. This is why I really enjoyed my project-based classes, where we were able to solve  real life problems. After graduation, I got a job and like any kid out of college, I thought I knew it all and was set for life. No more classes. No more reading. No more learning.</p>
			<p class='description bioText'>An opportunity came up in my job to learn the coding behind a new tool that was being implemented. I volunteered to learn it because I've always had an interest in coding and in learning how things work. Initially, the mountain in front of me was learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. A mountain that I never thought that I would be able climb. Once I completed that, I started to hear about frameworks and libraries and front-ends and back-ends, and that when I realized that software is a seemingly never ending pile of new things to learn.</p>
			<p class='description bioText'>Once I realized there are endless things to learn, I was immediately hooked, all I wanted to do was learn new technologies. This is when I realized, that learning is a life and career long process and I want to continue that journey in software.</p>
			<br>
			<p class='description bioText'>Now I am searching for a position that I can do web development full time, and help me to continue to learn and grow.</p>
